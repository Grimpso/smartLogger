WHAT IS OOP?
oop is way of writing programs by thinking in terms of real-world objects insted of functions and variables
it improves ----scalability,maintainability,reusablity,security etc;

WHAT IS CLASS?
class is a blueprint which defines what will object have(data) and what will object do(functions);
example->blueprint of house

WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
object is a real instance which is created from a class
ex->class-car
    object->my car

--------(class does not take memory,object takes memory)----------

WHAT IS AN ENCAPSULATION?
encapsulation means hieding internal details and allowing access only through controlled methods
ex->atm machine-we only writ pin we dont care about internal details that how it works

WHY WE USE ENCAPSULATION?
for improving security, control access, prevent misuse, clean design

------------------(make data private,expose behaviour)----------------------------

----------------------(external entity are main()function,another class, other object, any code not inside the class own method)---------------------------

WHAT IS ABSTRACTION?
abstraction means showing only what is necessary and hiding how it is done
(only focus on what an object does,not how it does it)
ex-> tv remote->you press on,you dont know how cercuits works
EX->sort(arr,arr+n);

WHAT ABSTRACTION PROVIDE US?
abstraction provide us loose coupled,nice structure, easy extension safer design

WHAT IS ABSTRACT CLASS?
abstract class cannot be instantiated and is used as a base class
a class become abstract class if it has pure virtual function

WHAT IS PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION?
it is a function that has no implementation in base class and must be implemented by derived class
virtual void draw()=0;
